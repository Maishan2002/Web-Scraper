Maldives gazzete is a website maldivians and expatriates frequent for many different purposes. Usually to find jobs. The GUI of the website tends to make things look quite crowded which takes away from the viewing experience. Therefore I created a web scraper using python to take important job details such as job title, office, date of posting, deadline and job description link in an attempt to make the process of viewing jobs more simple. The following libraries of beautifulsoup and requests have been used to produce this web scraper. The web scraper will take data from the first two pages and write them down concisely on a text file named jobs.txt. The text file can be accessed to find all the data related to a particular job entry group together and separated from other job information.
